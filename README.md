# Purpose

This repository contains the resulting code from my DevoxxBE [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJm8g83vqA) that shows how to create a Quarkus application using Spring APIs.

There is nothing special you need to do to use this, it's just what you get if you create a Quarkus application with Spring Web and Spring Data JPA and code up the example I did during the demo.
